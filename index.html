                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>
                  Parallel coordinates are a way to visualize multi-dimensional data. In the visualization, there is one axis for each dimension. Traditionally, the axes are vertical. Each object in the dataset represented with a polyline that connects the object's values in each dimension. Parallel coordinates are meant to help users detect patterns and trends in multi-dimensional data.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Multi-dimensional data often does not have an inherent ordering of the dimensions, so the axes in parallel coordinates can have any order. However, this order has a large impact on what the visualization looks like. Certain trends or patterns in the data can be easier with some axes orderings than others.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The parallel coordinates plot below is for a cars dataset. Above the visualization, there is a "Shuffle Axes" button. You can click that button randomly arrange the axes, which will give you a sense of the impact that axis order has on the visualization.
                </p>

                <div>
                  <button id="shuffle">Shuffle Axes</button>
                  <div id="pc1"></div>
                </div>

                <p>
                  Given this, we can try to find the order of the axes that optimizes some desired property. This process involves calculating a weight for each pair of axes and then finding the ordering of axes that minimizes or maximizes the sum of the weights. In this project, I will focus on minimizing the number of between axis edge crossings. The intuition behind this is that having a lot of edge crossings can make the visualization difficult to read.

                <h2>Edge Crossings</h2>

                <p>
                  The first step is to calculate the number of edge crossings between each pair of axes.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Following the notation used by Dasgupta and Kosara, \((l_i, r_i)\) represents a line segment from position \(l_i\) on the left axis to position \(r_i\) on the right axis [CITE]. If we have two lines like shown below,
                </p>

                <img src="diagrams/edge-crossing.svg">

                <p>
                  then in constant time, we know there is a line crossing if \((l_1 > l_2 \wedge r_1 < r_2) \vee (l_1 < l_2 \wedge r_1 > r_2))\). We are only concerned with intersections that occur between the axes. A brute force approach to get the total number of edge crossings between a pair of axis can therefore be done in \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the dataset.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Dasgupta and Korsara propose another approach, which depends on the height of the visualization rather than on the size of the dataset. Parallel coordinates are visualized on screens that have discrete pixels. If an axis is  \(h\) pixels high, then \(l_i\) and \(r_i\) are in the range \([0, h)\). We can then create a two-dimensional histogram representing the lines between a pair of axes, with bins defined as follows.
                </p>

                <p>\[b_{ij} = |\{ k | \lfloor l_k \rfloor = i \wedge \lfloor r_k \rfloor = j\}|\]</p>

                <p>\(b_{ij}\) represents the number of lines that go from pixel \(i\) on the left axis to pixel \(j\) on the right axis. The authors state that this histogram can be used to calculate the number of edge crossings between the two axis:</p>

                <p>
                  \[\sum_{i=0}^{h-1} \sum_{j=0}^{h-1} \sum_{k=i+1}^{h-1} \sum_{l=j+1}^{h-1} b_{ij}b_{kl}\]
                </p>

                <p>
                  However, as best I can tell, this is incorrect. Consider the case when you have two parallel lines, \((0, 0)\) and \((1, 1)\). That is, one line goes from pixel 0 on the left axis to pixel 0 on the right axis and the other goes from pixel 1 on the left axis to pixel 1 on the right axis. In this situation, \(b_{00} = 1\) and \(b_{11} = 1\). The first iteration will add \(b_{00}b_{11} = 1\) to the count, even though there is no crossing. I realized this while making the below animation. It seems the algorithm can be salvaged by looping over the columns in reverse order. If we take \(\sum_{j=h-1}^{0}\) to mean counting down from \(h-1\) to \(0\), then we have:
                </p>

                <p>
                  \[\sum_{i=0}^{h-1} \sum_{j=h-1}^{0} \sum_{k=i+1}^{h-1} \sum_{l=j-1}^{0} b_{ij}b_{kl}\]
                </p>

                <p>
                  This algorithm is \(O(h^4)\), though as the authors note, \(b_{ij}\) is often 0, which reduces the amount of work needed to be done.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Below is an animation to see how the algorithm works, inspired by Fig. 1 in [CITE]. In this example, there are two axes, A and B, that are each 5 pixels high. To add an edge, you first click on a pixel in one axis and then click on a pixel in the other axes. Or, you can click the "Random" button to add random edges. As add edges, the histogram to the right will update. Clicking "Calculate Crossings" will animate the steps the algorithm takes. \(b_{ij}\) is shown in blue and \(b_{kl}\) is shown in red when there is no crossing or green when there is a crossing.
                </p>

                  We can run our edge crossing algorithm of choice to get the number of crossings between each possible pair of axes. The below table shows the results for the cars dataset.
